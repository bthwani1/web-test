## Next actions to reach 100%
- Capture staging headers → reports/headers/staging.json. Run header and cookies gates.
- Run Lighthouse CI and Pa11y on staging. Commit reports.
- Add .env.example with APP_ENV and APP_URL at minimum. Document required keys.
- Define observability/alerts.json with runbook links.
- Commit evidence/release/rollback_tests.json for freshness check.
- Commit policies/exceptions.json if you rely on temporary exemptions.
- Provide logs sample or confirm none. Run PII scan.
- Define egress allowlist or confirm no external hosts.
